Input: We wanted to appeal to a younger set of consumers and also , in line with that goal , redo our image ...
Response: That's correct . If you remember , we also set a goal to double distribution in overseas markets . Now , when looking at the data to evaluate whether or not we made our goals , there are three things to consider . First , the original condition of the market , second , our marketing numbers from the previous year , and third , our final sales figures for this year . Now I want to describe for you the second and third parts . If you look at the overhead , you'll see a graph ... The blue line represents our sales from the year 2005 , the red line is the sales in 2006 ... As you can see , our sales in 2005 were quite slow to start off with , but managed to make decent performance in the last part of the year . On the other hand , you can see this year's sales took off like a rocket .
