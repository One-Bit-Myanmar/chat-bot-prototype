Input: So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...
Response: No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system .

The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
